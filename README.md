Problem statement: Star Rating Feature in Vanilla Js

Must-Have Features
* Rating from 1 to 5 
* when click -> rating should appear 
    : count should be printed
    : stars should be highlighted
* on hover -> highlight the stars
* on mouse leave -> highlighted stars should track back to 
previous state 

Good to have features->optimization, accessibility
* put emojis instead of numbers
* Slider-based star rating

How to run this file
* Download the folder and double-click on index.html
