Problem statement : Star Rating Feature in Vanilla Js

Must Have features
* Rating from 1 to 5 
* when click -> rating should appear 
    : count should be printed
    : stars should be highlighted
* on hover -> highlight the stars
* on mouse leave -> highlisghted stars should track back to 
previous state 

Good to have features->optimization , accessibility
* put emojis instead of numbers
* slider based star rating
